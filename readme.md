# Overview  

This project is a way for the local community to get more business during COVID  
as well as a way to push myself to create high quality content.  

## Local Businesses  
The local shops and businesses will be stored in a JSON file, which will include  
their names, their addresses, any events they may host and a link to their website  
or social media platform.  

Any relevant information will be listed on the directory page under each business.  
This will provide local students or residents the opportunity to get to know  
their area and help out while COVID is still rampant.
